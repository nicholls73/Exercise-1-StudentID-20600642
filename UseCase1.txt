GOAL: to allow an engineer to park the wind turbine
PRIMARY ACTOR: engineer
SECONDARY ACTORS: wind turbine
PRECONDITION: engineer has identified themselves with keycard to the system and wind turbine is not parked
TRIGGER: engineer selects the "park wind turbine" option
FLOW OF EVENTS: 1. The system asks for the password.
                2. The engineer enters the password.
                3. The system asks for confirmation to park the wind turbine.
                4. The engineer selects the confirm option.
                5. The system tells the wind turbine to start the packing up process.
                6. The system displays that the wind turbine has been successfully parked.
                7. The system logs the time, date and identity of who parked the wind turbine.
EXTENSIONS:     2A - The engineer enters the incorrect password.
                    1. The system displays that the password is incorrect.
                    2. The use case resumes at step 1.
                5A - The system is told that the parking proccess was unsuccessful by the wind turbine.
                    1. The system displays that the parking process was unsuccessful and the wind turbine needs to be inspected physically for why the parking process is being prevented.
                    2. The use case resumes at step 3.

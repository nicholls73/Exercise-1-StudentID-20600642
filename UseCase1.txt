GOAL: to allow an engineer to park the wind turbine.
PRIMARY ACTOR: engineer
SECONDARY ACTORS: wind turbine
PRECONDITION: engineer has identified themselves with keycard.
TRIGGER: engineer selects the "park wind turbine" option.
FLOW OF EVENTS: 1. The system asks the engineer for the password.
                2. The engineer enters the password.
                3. The system prompts the user for a confirmation to park the wind turbine.
                4. The engineer selects the confirm option.
                5. The system then tells the wind turbine to start the packing up process.
                6. The system then notifies the engineer that the wind turbine has been successfully parked.
                7. The system then logs the time, date and engineer who parked the wind turbine.
EXTENSIONS:     2A - The engineer enters the incorrect password.
                    1. The system tells the user that the password is incorrect.
                    2. The use case resumes at step 1.
                5A. - The system is told that the parking proccess was unsuccessful by the wind turbine.
                    1. The system notifies the engineer that the parking process was unsuccessful and the wind turbine needs to be inspected physically for why the parking process is being prevented.
                    2. The use case resumes at step 3.
